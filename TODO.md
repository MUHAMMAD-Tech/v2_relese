  - Admin access code: stored in database, changeable via Settings
  - Holder access codes: auto-generated, unique per holder
  - Single unified login input checks admin code first, then holder codes
- **Backend**: Using Supabase instead of Node.js + Express + SQLite
- **Token Whitelist**: Top 50 native coins only, enforced at backend level
- **No Real Money**: All transactions are informational, require manual admin approval
- **Price Updates**: CoinGecko API with 1-second refresh, backend caching
- **Design**: Premium dark fintech aesthetic with electric blue (#00d4ff) and amber (#fbbf24)
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
